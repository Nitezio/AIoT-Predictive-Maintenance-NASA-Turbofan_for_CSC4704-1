### CSC4704 Group Project | Topic 4: Predictive Maintenance using Industrial IoT Data
**Dataset:** NASA C-MAPSS FD001 | **Model:** Random Forest Regressor

## 📖 Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end **Predictive Maintenance Pipeline** for commercial turbofan engines. By analyzing sensor data from the **NASA C-MAPSS FD001 dataset**, the system predicts the **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of engines. This allows maintenance teams to schedule repairs proactively, preventing catastrophic failures and optimizing operational costs.

### Key Features

* **🤖 Machine Learning:** Random Forest Regressor trained on 100 run-to-failure engine trajectories.
* **⚙️ Feature Engineering:** Rolling statistics (mean, std) to capture temporal degradation patterns.
* **📊 Interactive Dashboard:** Streamlit-based web interface for real-time visualization of fleet health.
* **🛠️ Maintenance Insights:** Automated "Critical/Warning/Healthy" status classification based on RUL thresholds.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to set up the environment and run the system.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nitezio/AIoT-Predictive-Maintenance-NASA-Turbofan_for_CSC4704-1.git
cd AIoT-Predictive-Maintenance-NASA-Turbofan_for_CSC4704-1
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
# Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Train the AI Model (⚠️ MANDATORY)

You must run the training script first. The dashboard relies on CSV files (`predictions.csv`, etc.) that are generated by this script. These files are excluded from the repository via `.gitignore` to keep the repo clean.

```bash
python train_model.py
```

**✅ What happens when you run this?** The script will process the raw data in `data/`, train the Random Forest model, and generate the following files in your root directory:

- `model.pkl`: The saved trained model file.
- `predictions.csv`: Model predictions vs. Actual RUL for the test set.
- `importance.csv`: Feature importance rankings.
- `processed_test_history.csv`: Processed time-series data for plotting.

### 4. Launch the Dashboard

Once the model is trained and files are generated, start the visual interface:

```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

Your browser will automatically open the dashboard at `http://localhost:8501`.

## 🖥️ Dashboard Walkthrough

The dashboard is divided into five key sections:

### 1️⃣ Overview & Performance
View high-level model metrics (MAE, RMSE) and dataset details.

### 2️⃣ Data Insights
Explore sensor correlations via heatmaps to understand data redundancy and relationships between sensors.

### 3️⃣ Predictions Analysis
Compare Predicted RUL vs. Actual RUL to assess model accuracy across the entire test fleet.

### 4️⃣ Unit Specific Analysis
Deep dive into individual engines. Select a Unit ID to visualize its specific sensor degradation path over time and see how sensor readings evolve as the engine approaches failure.

### 5️⃣ Maintenance Insights
- **Fleet Status Board:** Instantly see which engines are CRITICAL (<20 cycles), WARNING (<50 cycles), or HEALTHY.
- **Actionable List:** A table allowing engineers to prioritize the most critical units.
- **Feature Importance:** Technical breakdown of which sensors (e.g., Sensor 11 Std Dev) are driving the AI's predictions.

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Data Preprocessing
- **Sensor Selection:** We focus on sensors 2, 3, 4, 7, 11, and 15, which show the strongest correlation with engine degradation in the FD001 dataset.
- **Rolling Windows:** To capture the rate of change, we compute rolling means and standard deviations (window size = 5) for these sensors.

### Modeling Strategy
- **Algorithm:** Random Forest Regressor (Ensemble learning approach).
- **RUL Clipping:** The target RUL is clipped at 125 cycles. This "Piecewise Linear" approach teaches the model that new engines have a constant "healthy" phase before linear degradation begins.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Error: `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'predictions.csv'`**
- **Cause:** You did not run `train_model.py` before starting the dashboard.
- **Solution:** Stop the dashboard (Ctrl+C) and run `python train_model.py`.

**Error: `FileNotFoundError: data/train_FD001.txt not found`**
- **Cause:** The raw dataset files are missing.
- **Solution:** Ensure the `data/` folder exists and contains the NASA dataset files.

**Dashboard shows no data**
- Check that `predictions.csv`, `importance.csv`, and `processed_test_history.csv` exist in the root directory.
